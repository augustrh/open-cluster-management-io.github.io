The Configuration policy controller is provided by Open Cluster Management and runs on managed clusters.
Prerequisites You must meet the following prerequisites to install the configuration policy controller:
Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure Golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.
Ensure the open-cluster-management policy framework is installed. See Policy Framework for more information.</description></item><item><title>Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper</title><link>https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers/gatekeeper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers/gatekeeper/</guid><description>Gatekeeper is a validating webhook with auditing capabilities that can enforce custom resource definition-based policies that are run with the Open Policy Agent (OPA). Gatekeeper constraints can be used to evaluate Kubernetes resource compliance. You can leverage OPA as the policy engine, and use Rego as the policy language.
Installing Gatekeeper See the Gatekeeper documentation to install the desired version of Gatekeeper to the managed cluster.
Sample Gatekeeper policy Gatekeeper policies are written using constraint templates and constraints.</description></item></channel></rss>
