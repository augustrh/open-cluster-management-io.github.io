(To run on hub cluster version between [v1.16, v1.18], please manually enable feature gate &amp;ldquo;V1beta1CSRAPICompatibility&amp;rdquo;). Currently the bootstrap process relies on client authentication via CSR. Therefore, if your Kubernetes distributions (like EKS) don&amp;rsquo;t support it, you can choose the multicluster-controlplane as the hub controlplane. Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed. Network requirements Configure your network settings for the hub cluster to allow the following connections.</description></item><item><title>Register a cluster</title><link>https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/installation/register-a-cluster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/installation/register-a-cluster/</guid><description>After the cluster manager is installed on the hub cluster, you need to install the klusterlet agent on another cluster so that it can be registered and managed by the hub cluster.
Prerequisite The managed clusters should be v1.11+. Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed. Network requirements Configure your network settings for the managed clusters to allow the following connections.
Direction Endpoint Protocol Purpose Used by Outbound https://{hub-api-server-url}:{port} TCP Kubernetes API server of the hub cluster OCM agents, including the add-on agents, running on the managed clusters To use a proxy, please make sure the proxy server is well configured to allow the above connections and the proxy server is reachable for the managed clusters.</description></item></channel></rss>
